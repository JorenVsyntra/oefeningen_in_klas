        // Complete this arrow function that takes a child's name and number of gifts
        // and returns a festive message. Use template literals!
        // Example output: "Ho ho ho! Maria has been good and gets 5 presents!"

        const santaMessage = /* your code here */

        // Fix the scope issues in this code so the elves can track their toy production
        function trackToyProduction() {
            var totalToys = 100;

            console.log(totalToys);  // Should print 100, not 50
            console.log(dailyToys);  // Should cause an error - why?

        /* Create a comprehensive gift management system that combines:
            1. Arrow functions for gift processing
            2. Proper scope management with let/const

            Requirements:
            - Create an arrow function that adds gifts to a child's list
            - Use block scope to manage different gift categories (toys, books, clothes)
            - Handle cases where:
            * Gift weight exceeds sleigh capacity (>25kg)
            * Child's name is not on the nice list
            * Invalid gift category
        */

        /* Build an elf workshop simulator that:
            1. Uses arrow functions for each production stage
            2. Manages scope for workshop sections

            Create functions for:
            - paintToy (arrow function)
            - assembleToy (arrow function)
            - qualityCheck (arrow function)

            Each function should:
            - Use block-scoped variables for tracking paint colors, parts, etc.
            - Keep track of successful vs failed toys
            */

            /* Create a Christmas Eve delivery route optimizer that:
            1. Uses arrow functions for calculations
            2. Properly scopes variables for different time zones

            Features to implement:
            - Calculate optimal route between chimneys
            - Handle timezone changes
            - Account for weather conditions
            - Track reindeer energy levels

            Use proper scope management for:
            - Current timezone data
            - Weather conditions
            - Reindeer status
